Print out the value of "Hello how are you doing today".

The variable "x" has value 5.
The variable "y" has value 20.

The function "multiply" takes in "x" and "y". If "x" is greater than 0 and "y" is greater than 0, then the variable "send" has value "x" times "y". Return "send". That ends the function "multiply".

Print out the value of calling "multiply" on "x" and "y".
